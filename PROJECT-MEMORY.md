## Architectural Understanding

### Technology Stack
- **Frontend:** Next.js 14 (App Router), TypeScript, React 18, Tailwind CSS, Framer Motion
- **Backend:** Node.js 18+, Express.js, JWT authentication
- **Database:** PostgreSQL 15 (primary), Redis 7 (cache/sessions)
- **State:** Zustand (auth), React Query (data fetching)
- **Deployment:** Railway (production), Docker Compose (development)
- **Future:** OpenAI GPT-4, WhatsApp Business API, AWS Route 53, Cloudflare R2

### Core Architecture Patterns

**Multi-Tenant Model:**
```
organizations (root)
  ├── users (organization_id FK)
  ├── clients (organization_id FK)
  ├── proposals (organization_id FK)
  └── all other entities scope to organization
```

**Authentication Flow:**
1. Login → JWT access token (15m) + refresh token (7d)
2. Zustand store (client-side)
3. Axios interceptors (auto-attach Bearer token)
4. Token refresh hook (auto-renew before expiration)
5. Logout → Server invalidation + client clear

**Proposal Lifecycle:**
```
Aberta (blue) → Client reviews
  ↓
Alterações Solicitadas (yellow) → Client requests changes
  ↓
Fechada (green) → Approved, ready for contract
  or
Rejeitada (red) → Rejected
```

**File Structure (Critical):**
```
services/
├── frontend/           # Next.js 14 App Router
│   ├── src/app/       # Pages (auth, dashboard, clients, reports, proposal)
│   ├── src/components/ # React components (barrel exports)
│   ├── src/store/     # Zustand (auth, ui, types)
│   ├── src/hooks/     # Custom hooks (useAuth, useTokenRefresh)
│   └── src/lib/       # API client (Axios with interceptors)
├── api/               # Express.js REST API
│   ├── src/models/    # Database models (uses DATABASE_URL)
│   ├── src/routes/    # API endpoints
│   ├── src/middleware/ # Validation, LGPD
│   └── src/utils/     # Brazilian validators (CPF/CNPJ)
└── database/          # PostgreSQL schemas and migrations
```

## Development Methodology

### "Vibe Coding" Approach
1. **Vision & Taste:** Clear product intent with strong UX focus
2. **Tight Loops:** Plan → Build → Test → Learn cycles
3. **Proof:** Runnable code and demos at each iteration
4. **Quality Bars:** Automated checks
5. **Calm Defaults:** Sensible assumptions
6. **Human-in-the-Loop:** Sign-offs at key gates

### Multi-Agent System
- **MAESTRO:** Central orchestrator (always invoke first)
- **Alpha Crew (10):** Research & Planning
- **Beta Crew (58):** Development & Implementation
- **Gamma Crew (10):** Quality, Security, Deployment

**Key Agents:**
- **ORION:** Full-stack development
- **NOVA:** Frontend (Next.js/React)
- **CASSANDRA:** Database
- **AURELIA:** UI/UX (glassmorphism)
- **RAILWAY CONDUCTOR:** Deployment
- **TESTER:** Autonomous stress testing
- **FORTRESS:** Security & LGPD

---

## Critical Operating Rules (NEVER VIOLATE)

### Docker-Only Development
- ❌ **NEVER** run `npm run dev` locally
- ✅ **ALWAYS** use Docker: `docker-compose restart frontend`
- ✅ Apply changes via container restart
- ✅ All services must be containerized

### Permission-Based Actions
- ❌ **NEVER** install packages without permission
- ❌ **NEVER** create Docker resources without approval
- ❌ **NEVER** run npm install automatically
- ✅ **ALWAYS** ask before installing anything

### User Interaction
- ✅ **ALWAYS** ask for "NEXT" before new phase
- ✅ **ALWAYS** ask for testing approval at milestones
- ✅ **ALWAYS** wait for confirmation before proceeding
- ✅ **ASSUME** user is not an experienced coder
- ✅ **TEACH** and explain everything clearly

### Transparency
- ✅ **NEVER** lie about development progress
- ✅ **NEVER** show features as ready when they're not
- ✅ **ALWAYS** tell the truth about implementation status
- ✅ **UPDATE** development.md at every milestone

### Color Pickers
- ❌ **BANNED:** HTML `<input type="color">`
- ✅ **REQUIRED:** Use ColorDropdown component from color scheme system

---

## Common Development Commands

### Docker (Primary Method)
```bash
# Start all services
docker-compose up -d

# Restart specific service (after code changes)
docker-compose restart frontend
docker-compose restart api

# View logs
docker-compose logs -f frontend
docker-compose logs -f api

# Stop all
docker-compose down

# Clean slate (removes volumes)
docker-compose down -v

# Database access
docker exec -it webpropostas-postgres psql -U webpropostas_user -d webpropostas
```

### Testing
```bash
# Frontend tests
cd services/frontend
npm test
npm run test:coverage

# Backend tests
cd services/api
npm test
npm run test:integration
```

### Railway Deployment
```bash
railway login
cd services/api  # or services/frontend
railway init
railway up
railway logs
```

---

## Known Issues & Solutions

### Railway Deployment
- **Build timeout:** Root directory not set → Set `services/api` in Settings → Source
- **No URL:** Public Networking disabled → Enable in Settings → Networking
- **DB errors:** Wrong DATABASE_URL → Copy exact string from Railway Variables

### Local Development
- **Port conflicts:** Services running → Stop processes or change ports
- **DB refused:** PostgreSQL not started → `docker-compose up -d postgres`
- **CORS errors:** Wrong CORS_ORIGIN → Match frontend URL in API .env

---

## Next Milestone to Achieve

**Current Target:** Phase 20 - AI Integration (4 weeks)

**What Needs to Be Done:**
1. OpenAI GPT-4 API integration
2. Content assistance features (rewrite, translate, tone shift)
3. Token management by tier (50K/200K tokens per month)
4. Cost monitoring and optimization
5. AI response time <500ms target

**Blockers:** None identified
**Dependencies:** OpenAI API key, billing setup
**Estimated Start:** Awaiting user approval to proceed

**Next After Phase 20:**
- Phase 21: Design Import (Canva/Gamma) - 6 weeks
- Phase 22: Media Processing (Nano Banana) - 4 weeks
- Phase 23: Contract Automation - 6 weeks

## Recent Updates & Changes

### January 6, 2025 - 🚀 MARKETPLACE MODULE ADDED (MAJOR EXPANSION)

**Decision:** Transform WebPropostas from "receive proposals" platform into full marketplace where clients can actively discover and request services.

**What Changed:**
1. **New Module:** Marketplace Search & Discovery (Phase 46)
   - Product/service/campaign search across all categories
   - Advanced filtering (location, price, rating, availability)
   - Provider profiles with portfolios and reviews
   - Quote request system (one form → multiple providers)
   - Map view with geolocation
   - Save/favorite listings
   - Integrated workflow: Search → Quote → Proposal → Project → Payment

2. **Database Schema:** 6 new tables designed
   - `marketplace_categories` (hierarchical)
   - `marketplace_listings` (core entity - 10,000+ expected)
   - `marketplace_quote_requests` (lead generation)
   - `marketplace_reviews` (trust & transparency)
   - `marketplace_saved_listings` (user favorites)
   - `marketplace_listing_views` (analytics)
   - See: `MARKETPLACE-SCHEMA.md` for complete specification

3. **Search Categories Defined:**
   - 🏗️ Construction & Home Services (contractors, architects, engineers)
   - 🏠 Real Estate (apartments, houses, commercial properties)
   - 🚗 Vehicles (cars, motorcycles, dealerships)
   - 👨‍🏫 Personal Services (teachers, cooks, trainers, professionals)
   - 🎉 Event Services (weddings, catering, photographers)

4. **Business Model Impact:**
   - Premium listings: R$ 47/month
   - Lead generation: R$ 5-15 per quote request
   - Featured placement: R$ 97/month
   - Future marketplace commission: 2-5%
   - Strong network effects (more providers = more clients = more value)

5. **Documentation Created:**
   - `COMPLETE-VISION.md` updated (Module #2 on client side)
   - `MARKETPLACE-SCHEMA.md` (complete database design, 600+ lines)
   - `PRESENTATION-PLAN.md` updated (new marketplace demo section)
   - Presentation page specifications with ASCII mockups
   - Demo script updated (15 min client journey now includes marketplace)

**Why This Is Revolutionary:**
- Only platform offering: Search → Quote → Proposal → Project Management → Payment tracking (all in one)
- Unlike GetNinjas/Habitissimo: Integrated proposal quality + project management
- Network effect moat: More providers = better search = more clients = more value
- Competitive advantage: Every provider has verified portfolio from platform proposals

**Implementation Priority:**
- For presentation (Jan 13): Placeholder page with sample listings
- Post-presentation: Full search, filters, quote requests, reviews

### January 6, 2025 - Vision Document Translation
- Translated visão_geral.md (Portuguese) to overview.md (English)
- Original vision document outlines comprehensive platform modules
- Document shows initial vision before current roadmap development
- Notable differences from current implementation:
  - Original vision included extensive client-side portal features
  - Many modules align with current Phase 44-45 (Client Portal) plans
  - Template builder concept matches current Phase 26-39 implementation
