## Key Decisions & Learnings

### Architecture Decisions
1. **Multi-Agent Orchestration**: Chose MAESTRO system with 3 crews (Alpha Discovery, Beta Delivery, Gamma Excellence)
2. **Containerization**: All services must be Docker containerized (per CLAUDE.md guidelines)
3. **Brazilian-First Design**: All agents incorporate LGPD compliance and local market understanding
4. **Human-in-the-Loop**: Mandatory approval gates before phase transitions

### Development Methodology
- **Vibe Coding**: Rapid, taste-driven iteration balancing speed and craft
- **Evidence-Based**: All decisions require citations and supporting evidence
- **Transparency**: Never lie about development progress, always show true feature status
- **Educational Approach**: Assume user is not experienced coder, provide teaching and guidance

### Quality Standards Established
- **Test Coverage**: > 80% unit tests, > 70% integration tests
- **Security**: Zero critical/high vulnerabilities in scans
- **Performance**: Sub-3-second loading times globally
- **Accessibility**: WCAG 2.2 AA compliance
- **Documentation**: Complete API documentation and runbooks required
