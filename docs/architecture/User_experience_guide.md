new lets create a user step by step path to consolidate the product propose and if needed adjust all the documents:
1. user arrives on the landing page that have multiple subpages with: a complete presentation of the service, a few templates, splashscreens of the proposal builder and the template builders, splashscreen of the proposal GPT interaction, splashscreens of the dashboards, etc... to show how the system works and all the funcionalities (individual pages with a fixed navbar that alow him to flutuate between features and funcionalities)
2. user choose a plan (freemium / standard / professional)
3. user go to the payment page (mist of register page and payment method) or direct to the register page (if freemium)
4. user register on the platform (with 2FA)
5. user enters the platform

	- insert the texts on the content boxes of the choosed template (freemium)
	- insert text on the content boxes of the choosed / created template (standard) and use the AI for creating the content (button that opens a popup AI window with the inserted content so the user can update the tex proposal using AI, with a GPT chat like UI) - available token counting
	- insert text on the content boxes of the choosed / created / loaded template (professional) and use the AI for creating the content (button that opens a popup AI window with the inserted content so the user can update the tex proposal using AI, with a GPT chat like UI) - available token counting
9. user create the proposal (3 for freemium | 100 for standard | unlimited for professional)
10. once the proposal is created (freemium cannot edit | standard can edit manually | professional can use AI to edit)
