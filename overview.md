## 4. How Each Module Works:

### Service Provider and Seller Side:

#### General User Dashboard
In this module, the seller or service provider has an overview of their proposals, number of proposals sent, number of closed proposals, closing and negotiation alerts, general financial numbers (closed/open), number of active clients, number of sales campaigns, messages from clients requesting new quotes, lead results (likes on campaigns). In summary, the general dashboard is a summary of relevant information.

#### Client Registration Module
In this module, the seller and service provider registers their clients and leads, their characteristics, contact data, interests and relevant general information.

#### Proposal Registration and Creation Module
In this module, the seller and service provider can outline in general terms what their proposal is, what they intend to sell, rent, or perform, which client they intend to reach with the proposal, saves in predefined text fields things like general scope of proposals, differentials, objectives, engagement phrases, price, payment conditions, delivery conditions, etc. In this module, all information is placed in text boxes in a clear and textual way. In this module, these text insertion boxes may have AI assistance (depending on the contracted usage plan), for creating promotional texts, text correction and even translation into various languages.

#### Sales Campaign Registration and Creation Module
In this module, the seller and service provider can outline in general terms what their proposal is, what they intend to sell, rent, or perform, which clients they intend to reach with the proposal, saves in predefined text fields things like general scope of proposals, differentials, objectives, engagement phrases, price, payment conditions, delivery conditions, etc. In this module, all information is placed in text boxes in a clear and textual way. In this module, these text insertion boxes may have AI assistance (depending on the contracted usage plan), for creating promotional texts, text correction and even translation into various languages.

#### Graphic Development Module for Proposals and Templates (Ready-Made Models)
In this module, the seller, service provider or person responsible for the company/business marketing can combine the information registered in the proposal registration and creation modules and sales campaign registration and creation with the graphic part of the platform. This module is a Canva exclusively focused on commercial proposals, where the created texts can be automatically inserted into ready-made graphic templates, customized or entirely created by the user. Here, the entire logical base is united with the creative tool, enchantment, graphic presentation of products and services. Here users can insert graphics, images, videos, bullets, icons, designs, and texts (automatically, which were generated in the previous modules) into graphic materials rich in details, colors, and design, giving a professional presentation to their proposals, as if they had a marketing agency working 24/7 for them.

In this module, the user can use ready-made templates created exclusively by the WebPropostas design team, customize templates, create and save templates with logos, contact data, common use information, etc., greatly facilitating the creation of personalized and professional proposals. Anyone can, regardless of their training and creative ability, develop professional proposals with exclusive content, with engaging graphic quality that generates interest and mobilization around their products and campaigns.

The user simply chooses which proposal or campaign they want to use (registered in the proposals and campaigns module), which template they want to use, and automatically the AI assembles their proposal combining the best of both worlds. On one hand, the created texts are added to the graphic elements of the templates, which the AI uses in an integrated way to generate complete documents that can be edited and saved to be sent to clients registered in the proposals and campaigns module, automatically.

Once the graphic part of the proposal or campaign is approved by the user, the company, the sales team or administration, just click send and WebPropostas forwards the created material, through the channels chosen by the user automatically and transparently.

It should be noted that this module is collaborative and can be accessed by multiple users registered in the organization and authorized by the user, such as salespeople, marketing analysts, senior management, direction and presidency. In this multi-user and collaborative module, several people involved in the sales process can interact, generating comments, making changes (if allowed in reader/editor access), requesting corrections and changes, approving parts or the entire document. Once the proposal or campaign creation part is finished, it is transferred to the send module, to be prepared to follow its path to the market.

#### Send Module
In this module it is possible to choose the forms of sending whether by email, by WhatsApp, Telegram or file (save in PDF or PPTX), it is possible to choose the forms of response tracking (single send, reminder send in X days, periodic reminder send biweekly, monthly, semi-annual or annual) to remind clients of your products and campaigns repetitively or not, depending on the characteristics of the product and market, allowing the client to unsubscribe automatically if they wish (client receives reminder by email or WhatsApp and decides they no longer want to receive messages about that product or service, they can be automatically removed from the send list in order to respect LGPD).

#### Proposal Hosting Module
In the hosting module, proposals are online for client and lead visits. This module functions as a proper website for each proposal. Each proposal or campaign gains a premium online space, like its own website created only for it, which can be accessed from anywhere in the world immediately, organized, modern, attractive and professional.

Each proposal or campaign is online and gets a personalized web address, where clients can enter freely or with restrictions (with or without password access) and learn about the proposal without having to open documents, download heavy files full of images or videos. All proposals and campaigns are one click away from your client and lead, where they can learn about your product or service via web in an uncomplicated and professional way. Without having to download anything, without having to use space on their devices to store heavy documents.

And best of all, the proposals will always be there, one click away, whenever they want to access it, or send it to someone (share button), in a non-invasive and professional way. A potential client receives a house proposal, can send the link to the whole family to evaluate with just one click.

WebPropostas is the sales content democratization platform, where your product or service is the main focus at all times, generating measurable engagement that is demonstrated in the reports module (how many clicks, how many shares, how much viewing time, most successful leads, locations from where they were accessed by city, state, country and continent).

#### Proposal and Lead Tracking Module
In this module, the seller or service provider can track their sent proposals, cancel sends, end campaigns, send contracts, respond to clients who requested changes in terms and conditions, close deals, refuse deals, in short have an online tracking of all sent proposals in an organized way and without generating a single paper, contract, print, contributing to the environment and waste collection (many sales materials are automatically discarded by clients, who often don't even see the material and simply throw it away, generating enormous amounts of waste, which translates into financial loss for the company that generates the proposal and for the community that has to handle these residues, through recycling which is an expensive and complex process).

#### Client Progress and Results Presentation Module
In this module the seller can post texts, photos and videos, generate reports that are sent directly to clients demonstrating clearly the progress of contracts: the client can follow the renovation of their house, the car repair, the construction of the building where they will live, the planting of grass and plants for their landscaping, their children's guitar or English lessons, etc.

In this module, service providers and sellers can automatically give their clients the opportunity to participate "from inside" the contract execution process, generating engagement around their product and more leads. The client looks at a video of a well-done paint job, or a photo of a well-made garment, or their child learning a new language, or learning to swim and can share with their friends and relatives, generating more business and automatic leads. WebPropostas is a commercial and social engagement tool.

#### Contract Templates and Acceptance Terms Module
In this module, the user can have contract templates and acceptance terms, generated by AI with the general characteristics of their proposals automatically filled in, with client names, data, product data, etc., to be validated by the company's or service provider's legal representatives, and sent.

These documents can be sent for editing/validation via link, both to clients and lawyers and accountants, who with simple buttons and text boxes, make comments, edits and accept/reject the documents generated in the digital environment, without issuing or printing documents, automatically and professionally, with the entire process documented and recorded, with dates and access, holding each member of the process accountable for the action generated.

#### Results Analysis Module
In this analytics module, those responsible for companies, whether a self-employed professional, sales manager, or company director/president can follow in general terms the performance of proposals and campaigns, with general metrics of each product or campaign, service or sale in a comprehensive and professional way. Here proposals and campaigns become numbers, graphs and reports that can be followed in real time, saved and sent in an uncomplicated way, to accountants, investors, investment or interest groups.
