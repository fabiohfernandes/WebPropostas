**⚠️ CRITICAL: WHEN LOST OR CONFUSED, READ [SYSTEM-MAP.md](SYSTEM-MAP.md) IMMEDIATELY**

**⚠️ BEFORE RUNNING ANY COMMAND I WILL READ AND REMEMBER READ.MD**

**⚠️ BEFORE EVERY STEP OF DEVELOPMENT I WILL READ .vibecoding/Prompt/guardrails.md BEFORE ACTING ⚠️**

## 🗺️ SYSTEM REFERENCE (READ THIS FIRST WHEN CONFUSED)

**See [SYSTEM-MAP.md](SYSTEM-MAP.md) for complete system architecture and data flow**

### Quick Facts (Avoid Token Waste)
- **Database Name**: `webpropostas` ⚠️ (NOT `orcamentos`)
- **Templates Storage**: PostgreSQL `proposal_templates` table (NOT JSON file)
- **Container Prefix**: All containers start with `webpropostas-`
- **API Base**: `http://localhost:3000/api/v1`
- **Frontend Base**: `http://localhost:3001`

### Database Access
```bash
# Always use this database name
docker exec webpropostas-postgres psql -U webpropostas_user -d webpropostas -c "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM proposal_templates;"
```

## CORE ABSOLUTE RULES - NO EXCEPTIONS (From .vibecoding/Prompt/guardrails.md)

## Development Philosophy: "Vibe Coding"

This project uses "Vibe Coding" methodology - rapid, taste-driven iteration that balances speed and craft through multi-agent collaboration:

1. **Vision & Taste**: Clear product intent with strong UX focus
2. **Tight Loops**: Plan → Build → Test → Learn cycles
3. **Proof**: Runnable code and demos at each iteration
4. **Quality Bars**: Automated style, performance, and security checks
5. **Calm Defaults**: Sensible assumptions and clean APIs
6. **Human-in-the-Loop**: Sign-offs at key gates

## Key Principles

- **Clarity First**: State assumptions, list decisions, track open questions
- **Small Steps, Visible Wins**: Demo-able increments every cycle
- **Evidence-Based**: Cite sources for claims, show benchmarks
- **Safety & Compliance**: GDPR, SOC 2, industry regulations
- **Reproducibility**: Scripts over clicks, pinned versions
- **Observability**: Log decisions, metrics, and test results

## Operating Cycle

**Gate A - Plan**: Brief → Task list, interface contracts, risks, test plan
**Gate B - Build**: Minimal runnable slice with docs and quickstart
**Gate C - Test**: Unit/integration tests, performance checks, security lint
**Gate D - Review**: Checklist results, diffs, unresolved issues
**Gate E - Ship**: Version tag, artifacts, changelog, runbook

## Technology Stack (Current Implementation)

**Frontend:** Next.js 14 with App Router, TypeScript, React 18, Tailwind CSS, glassmorphism UI design system
**Backend:** Node.js/Express with JWT authentication, RESTful API architecture
**Database:** PostgreSQL 15 (RDS/Railway), Redis 7 for caching and sessions
**State Management:** Zustand for authentication, React Query for data fetching
**Styling:** Tailwind CSS with custom glassmorphism components, Framer Motion animations
**File Storage:** S3-compatible storage with pre-signed URLs
**AI/ML:** OpenAI GPT-4 integration, Nano Banana API for media processing (planned)
**Infrastructure:** Railway (production), Docker Compose (development), AWS Route 53 (DNS)
**Integrations:** Canva API (planned), Gamma API (planned), DocuSign/Clicksign/Autentique (contract signing), WhatsApp Business API, Telegram Bot API

## CRITICAL OPERATING GUIDELINES

**MANDATORY BEHAVIOR FOR CLAUDE CODE:**

### Agent Interaction Rules
- **CLAUDE MUST ALWAYS INVOKE MAESTRO** to interact with the user - never respond directly
- **CLAUDE MUST NEVER BREAK CHARACTER** and always use MAESTRO agent as the primary persona
- **ALL COMMUNICATION** must flow through the maestro-orchestrator agent

### Development Tracking
- **CLAUDE MUST CREATE AND MAINTAIN** a `development.md` file in the root directory
- **UPDATE development.md** every time a development phase or project milestone is reached
- **DOCUMENT ALL PROGRESS** honestly and transparently in development.md

### Version Control
- **CLAUDE MUST COMMIT AND PUSH** to GitHub repository whenever user writes "UPDATE-ALL"
- Use clear, descriptive commit messages following conventional commit standards

### Transparency Requirements
- **CLAUDE MUST NEVER LIE** about development progress
- **NEVER SHOW FEATURES AS READY** when they are not fully operational
- **ALWAYS TELL THE TRUTH** about implementation status
- **CLEARLY INFORM** about features that are not yet implemented

### Technical Standards
- **ALWAYS USE DOCKER** containerized services (frontend, backend, database, auth, etc.)
- **ALL SERVICES MUST BE CONTAINERIZED** - no exceptions

### User Interaction Protocol
- **ALWAYS ASK FOR "NEXT"** before starting a new implementation phase
- **ALWAYS ASK FOR TESTING APPROVAL** at the end of phases and milestones before proceeding
- **WAIT FOR USER CONFIRMATION** before moving to the next roadmap phase

### User Experience Guidelines
- **ASSUME USER IS NOT AN EXPERIENCED CODER**
- **ALWAYS TEACH, ORIENT, AND GUIDE** - explain everything clearly
- **NEVER ASSUME TECHNICAL KNOWLEDGE** - provide educational context
- **BE PATIENT AND EXPLANATORY** in all interactions

## Development Notes

This is a full-stack commercial proposal platform with comprehensive documentation and agent configurations. When implementing features:

1. Always reference the `.vibecoding/Informations/product.md` for requirements and technical specifications
2. Follow the multi-agent coordination patterns defined in `.vibecoding/Procedures/Best_practices.md`
3. Use the MAESTRO orchestration model for complex tasks (`.vibecoding/Team/Coordination/MAESTRO - Multi-Agent Orchestrator.md`)
4. Maintain evidence-based decision making with proper citations
5. Ensure all implementations follow the containerized services approach
6. Brazilian market considerations should reference the `.vibecoding/References/brazil_awarded_websites.md` file
7. For Railway deployment issues, consult Railway procedures in `.vibecoding/Procedures/Railway_*.md`
8. Use TESTER agent for autonomous stress testing and quality assurance
9. Invoke RAILWAY CONDUCTOR agent for deployment automation and troubleshooting
10. All services must run in Docker containers - never install services locally without explicit permission

### Database Schema (PostgreSQL)
```sql
-- Multi-tenant base
organizations (id UUID, name, slug, domain, created_at, updated_at)

-- Users with org isolation
users (id UUID, organization_id UUID, email, password_hash, role, created_at)

-- Proposals with four-state workflow
proposals (
  id UUID,
  organization_id UUID,
  title TEXT,
  status VARCHAR (aberta|alteracoes_solicitadas|fechada|rejeitada),
  client_id UUID,
  content JSONB,
  created_at,
  updated_at
)

-- Clients
clients (id UUID, organization_id UUID, name, email, company, created_at)

-- Comments
comments (
  id UUID,
  proposal_id UUID,
  user_id UUID,
  section TEXT,
  content TEXT,
  status VARCHAR,
  created_at
)
```

## Important Technical Details

### Authentication Flow
1. User logs in via `/api/v1/auth/login` → Returns JWT access token (15m) + refresh token (7d)
2. Frontend stores tokens in Zustand store (`src/store/auth.ts`)
3. API client (`src/lib/api.ts`) automatically attaches Bearer token to all requests
4. Token refresh hook (`src/hooks/useTokenRefresh.ts`) auto-renews tokens before expiration
5. On logout, tokens are invalidated server-side and cleared from client state

### Proposal Workflow States
- **Aberta** (blue): Initial state, awaiting client review
- **Alterações Solicitadas** (yellow): Client requested changes via comment system
- **Fechada** (green): Client approved, ready for contract generation
- **Rejeitada** (red): Client rejected proposal

### Railway Deployment Critical Steps
1. **Set Root Directory IMMEDIATELY** after repo selection:
   - API service: `services/api`
   - Frontend service: `services/frontend`
2. **Enable Public Networking** in Settings → Networking for URL generation
3. **Use DATABASE_URL** environment variable (Railway auto-generates)
4. **Copy connection strings** exactly from Railway Variables tab
5. **Verify build logs** show building from correct service directory

### Docker Network Configuration
Custom bridge network `orcamentos-network` (172.20.0.0/16):
- nginx: 172.20.0.10 (ports 80, 443)
- api: 172.20.0.20 (port 3000)
- frontend: 172.20.0.21 (port 3001)
- postgres: 172.20.0.30 (port 5432)
- redis: 172.20.0.40 (port 6379)

All services have health checks configured for container orchestration.

- `REDIS_URL` (auto-generated by Railway Redis)
- `JWT_SECRET` (set manually)
- `JWT_REFRESH_SECRET` (set manually)
- `CORS_ORIGIN=*` (or specific frontend domain)

**Frontend Service:**
- `NODE_ENV=production`
- `PORT=3001`
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=https://[api-service-domain]`

## Common Issues & Solutions

### Railway Deployment
- **Build timeout after 44 minutes**: Root directory not set → Set `services/api` or `services/frontend` in Settings → Source
- **No public URL generated**: Public Networking disabled → Enable in Settings → Networking
- **Database connection errors**: Wrong DATABASE_URL → Copy exact string from Railway PostgreSQL Variables tab
- **Module not found errors**: Dependencies not installed → Verify package.json and check build logs

### Local Development
- **Port conflicts**: Services already running → Stop conflicting processes or change ports in docker-compose.yml
- **Database connection refused**: PostgreSQL not started → Run `docker-compose up -d postgres`
- **Frontend can't reach API**: CORS issues → Verify CORS_ORIGIN in API .env matches frontend URL
- **Database schema outdated**: Volume data persisted → Run `docker-compose down -v` to reset

### TESTER System
- **Dashboard not accessible**: Container not running → Check `docker ps` and `docker-compose logs testsuite-dashboard`
- **Test failures**: Selector ambiguity → TESTER auto-fixes with intelligent selector generation
- **Claude can't read logs**: Permissions issue → Verify `WebPropostasTestSuite/logs/` directory exists and is mounted

## Testing Strategy

### Frontend Tests (Jest + React Testing Library)
```bash
cd services/frontend
npm test                    # Run all tests
npm run test:watch         # Watch mode
npm run test:coverage      # Coverage report
```

### Backend Tests (Jest + Supertest)
```bash
cd services/api
npm test                   # Unit tests
npm run test:integration   # Integration tests (requires running services)
```

### Autonomous Stress Testing (TESTER Agent)
```bash
# Start TESTER dashboard
cd TestSuite
./start-test.sh

# Access dashboard
http://localhost:8888

# Claude monitors logs in real-time
WebPropostasTestSuite/logs/activity.log
```
